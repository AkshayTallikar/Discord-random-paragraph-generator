# Discord-random-paragraph-generator
I used the discord api and gpt-2-simple api to form a random paragraph based only one thing you sent into the bot. It usally takes 5 iterations for the bot to complete the full paragraph.  There is a limit for how many word you can send because the prefix function only allows 2000 letters.

You can also allow for only one response by changing the code so that the bot doesn't read its own text.
