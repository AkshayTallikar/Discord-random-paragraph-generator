# Discord-random-paragraph-generator
I used the discord api and gpt-2-simple api to form a random paragraph based only one thing you sent into the bot. It will now complete the paragraph in one iteration.There is a limit for how many words you can send because the prefix function only allows 2000 letters.

# Running the bot
You can run the bot by using google colab. Repl.it and Wayscript dont like older versions of tensorflow which you need for this. Google colab should allow you 12 hours of runtime for the Free Version
