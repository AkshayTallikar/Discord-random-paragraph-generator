# Discord-random-paragraph-generator
I used the discord api and gpt-2-simple api to form a random paragraph based only one thing you sent into the bot. It usally takes 5 iterations for the bot to complete the full paragraph.  There is a limit for how many word you can send because the prefix function only allows 2000 letters.
